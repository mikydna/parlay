  "analysis_summary": "The provided deterministic model identifies five Tier A \"GO\" player-prop plays across three NBA games, led by Day'Ron Sharpe (IND @ BKN) and Nolan Traore (IND @ BKN). The model uses market-implied probabilities with manual adjustments for injuries/rosters/opponents and applies deterministic (v0) rules for minutes/usage projections and correlation haircuts. External news sources offer mixed supporting context for recent player performances and injury status but do not fully validate the model's probabilistic edges.",
  "bottom_line": "The model surfaces several plausible Tier A player-prop candidates and incorporates roster/injury adjustments; independent news sources provide some supporting performance and injury context (e.g., Sharpe, Okongwu, Oubre). However, the model relies on deterministic v0 rules for minutes/usage and correlation haircuts rather than learned distributions, and external sources do not corroborate the specific EV values. Evidence quality is mixed\u2014use the listed plays as informed signals, not definitive guarantees of profit.",
