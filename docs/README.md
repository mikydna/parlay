# Docs Guide

This folder is split into two groups:

## Active (operator + contract docs)

- `runbook.md` — canonical daily/operator commands.
- `scheduled-flow.md` — scheduled execution examples.
- `contracts.md` — report/brief/backtest/CLI output contracts.
- `sources.md` — source policy and health expectations.
- `credits.md` — quota and spend guidance.
- `backtest-prep.md` — next-day grading workflow.
- `nba-data.md` and `nba-data-schemas.md` — NBA lake module + schema docs.
- `plan.md` — canonical engineering/product roadmap and milestone plan.
- `strat-odds-api-integration.md` — source-policy rationale and integration context.

## Archived

- Historical/stale/completed docs are moved to `docs/archive/`.
- Archive docs are reference-only and should not be treated as active runbooks.
