  "analysis_summary": "Model ran in watchlist-only mode due to missing roster, injury, and market data in the snapshot (daily-20260213T230036Z). Public sources show active, up-to-date injury reports and widely-published sportsbook player-prop lines for February 13, 2026 \u2014 which supports the idea that the model\u2019s data ingestion/feeds (roster and official injury parsing, sportsbook/slate feeds) failed for this snapshot rather than the underlying information being absent. At the same time, multiple teams have current injuries and load-management moves that materially affect player minutes/usage, which validates the model\u2019s caution in not producing live candidate lines when injury/roster certainty is low.",
  "bottom_line": "Evidence indicates the underlying market and injury information for Feb 13, 2026 were publicly available (sportsbooks and injury trackers published lines and team injury reports). That supports the snapshot\u2019s decision to withhold model plays only if the ingestion/parsing of roster and official injury feeds failed \u2014 which the snapshot gaps explicitly report. In short: (1) the model\u2019s conservative watchlist-only behavior was defensible given the risk from missing/unclean roster and official injury inputs, and (2) the claim that no market lines existed is refuted by sportsbook and odds-aggregation pages publishing player-prop lines on Feb 13, 2026. If you want a production-ready brief, I recommend (A) re-running ingestion for the snapshot timestamp (daily-20260213T230036Z) with priority on the official injury/roster feeds and sportsbook APIs, and (B) validating minutes/usage variability by ingesting recent game log minutes and team rotation notes (to replace deterministic minutes rules) before producing candidate lines. If you want, I can (1) attempt a fresh live ingestion check for the specific roster/injury endpoints and sportsbook APIs now, or (2) produce a prioritized checklist for feed validation and re-run steps.",
