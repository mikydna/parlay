## Data Quality

- Execution report: all tickets priced and executed on DraftKings only.
- Actionable rows require DraftKings price >= PLAY-TO for the chosen side.
- Model uses market-implied fair probabilities with injury/roster/opponent adjustments.
- Minutes/usage projection uses deterministic v0 rules, not learned distributions.
- SGP/SGPx correlation uses deterministic haircut rules (v0).
- `unknown_roster` means the roster feed did not return a trusted active/inactive record for that player in that game snapshot.
- `unknown_event` means event-to-team mapping was missing, so player-to-game roster checks could not be resolved.

## Confidence

- Tier A lines are preferred over Tier B by default.
- Model probabilities are market-implied with injury/roster adjustments.

### Interpreting p(hit)

- `p(hit)` = estimated chance the recommended side wins at that line.
- Built from no-vig odds + small injury/roster/spread adjustments (clamped 1%-99%).
- Use it to rank EV, not as a guarantee; judge it by calibration over many bets.
- Can be wrong when odds are stale, coverage is thin, or minutes/role are uncertain.
