## Analyst Take

- mode: `llm_web`

### Read This First

The model identifies several high-expected-value (EV) player prop 'GO' recommendations concentrated on the DAL@LAL game, notably LeBron James (two props), Austin Reaves, Marcus Smart, and Jake LaRavia. The deterministic model uses market-implied probabilities with manual adjustments for injuries and rostering, but it also lists explicit gaps: minutes/usage projections and correlation treatments follow deterministi...

### News Signals

- Refutes/Risks:
  - [S1] Recent reporting indicates Austin Reaves will miss at least a month with a calf injury, which directly challenges the reliability of any GO recommendation depending on his availability.
  - [S2] Multiple news reports and injury updates show Austin Reaves has been on the Lakers injury report and there is coverage of his return/status, highlighting uncertainty about his game availability.
  - [S3] News coverage documents Austin Reaves' injury situation and team updates, indicating evolving status that could invalidate model assumptions about his minutes/usage.

### Bottom Line

- **Best Bet:** **LeBron James OVER 40.5 points+rebounds+assists @ -106 (fanduel)**
- **Lookup Line:** `DAL @ LAL` | `OVER 40.5 points+rebounds+assists` | `fanduel -106`
The model highlights attractive EV plays, mainly in DAL@LAL, but its deterministic handling of minutes/usage and correlation is a stated gap. More importantly, external news shows Austin Reaves has a significant calf injury with uncertain availability; that materially undermines any Reaves prop recommendation and raises caution for model outputs tied to roster/injury assumptions.

## Data Quality

- Model uses market-implied fair probabilities with injury/roster/opponent adjustments.
- Minutes/usage projection uses deterministic v0 rules, not learned distributions.
- SGP/SGPx correlation uses deterministic haircut rules (v0).
- `unknown_roster` means the roster feed did not return a trusted active/inactive record for that player in that game snapshot.
- `unknown_event` means event-to-team mapping was missing, so player-to-game roster checks could not be resolved.

## Confidence

- Recommendations reflect the model probabilities and EVs supplied in the payload; do not assume any data beyond this JSON.
- NO-GO items were marked in the payload primarily due to low EV and questionable injury status; consult live injury/in-play feeds before any action.

### Interpreting p(hit)

- `p(hit)` = estimated chance the recommended side wins at that line.
- Built from no-vig odds + small injury/roster/spread adjustments (clamped 1%-99%).
- Use it to rank EV, not as a guarantee; judge it by calibration over many bets.
- Can be wrong when odds are stale, coverage is thin, or minutes/role are uncertain.
